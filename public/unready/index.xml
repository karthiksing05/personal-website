      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is quite unorthodox for me, as I always try to keep my political beliefs out of social discussion, and I will be avoiding referencing real countries and governments so as to preserve the sanctity of the argument without bias. However, this work is extremely necessary, especially in light of some recent events regarding political activism and funding, not just in the USA, but across the world. This is a broader commentary on where power should come from, where priorities should lie, and what to take as &amp;ldquo;valuable&amp;rdquo; to iterate on humanity&amp;rsquo;s best whilst learning to let go of what holds us back. I&amp;rsquo;ll be discussing things in terms of resource allocation, so a more economical perspective, but know that my views can be easily transferred to a political dimension by referencing the value and distribution of responsibilities rather than resources.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
