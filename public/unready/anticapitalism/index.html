  <div class="post-content"><div>
        <p>This post is quite unorthodox for me, as I always try to keep my political beliefs out of social discussion, and I will be avoiding referencing real countries and governments so as to preserve the sanctity of the argument without bias. However, this work is extremely necessary, especially in light of some recent events regarding political activism and funding, not just in the USA, but across the world. This is a broader commentary on where power should come from, where priorities should lie, and what to take as &ldquo;valuable&rdquo; to iterate on humanity&rsquo;s best whilst learning to let go of what holds us back. I&rsquo;ll be discussing things in terms of resource allocation, so a more economical perspective, but know that my views can be easily transferred to a political dimension by referencing the value and distribution of responsibilities rather than resources.</p>
<p>Many who know me know that I deeply enjoy bashing on capitalism. Few know why I bash on capitalism (I promise it is for more than &ldquo;the bit&rdquo;, as I will explain later on in the article). Fewer still know that not only would I bash on capitalism (and socialism), but that I&rsquo;ve already devised the workings of a secret third system that is deceptively simple by nature but incredibly challenging to put into practice.</p>
<p>Though many other systems currently exist, I will be referring to capitalism and socialism in depth as they represent the natural opposites to the gradient of systems I define. Additionally, I may present information Atomism</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The main vice of capitalism is the uneven distribution of prosperity. The main vice of socialism is the even distribution of misery. <em>— Winston Churchill, Statesman and former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom</em></p></blockquote>
<h1 id="goals-and-definitions">goals and definitions<a href="#goals-and-definitions" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h1>
<p>In an effort to remain impartial while understanding this problem as analytically as possible, I&rsquo;m going to formalize some of the goals and definitions I have within the broader context of this subject, so that my lines of reasoning can be understood. Everything in this section is an assumption which I believe isn&rsquo;t wildly out of pocket, but I welcome additions and adjustments.</p>
<p>First, I define a system. These &ldquo;systems&rdquo; that I discuss can be thought of economically, militarily, politically, etc. I generalize all of these things to the idea that a &ldquo;system&rdquo; described within my framework is an <em>allocation of resources and responsibilities</em> within a community. Every community is backed by one of these systems. Politically, capitalism can be represented as the natural ordering of responsibilities such that everyone has a valued role in society proportional to their value as members of the community, and socialism can be represented as the natural ordering of responsibilities such that everyone has an equal role in society, independent of value.</p>
<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve defined a system, I&rsquo;m going to assert that it has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>I touched on this briefly in the last paragraph, but I justify that everything has value, and the value of everything can be categorized by some mystical equation, which I will reference as the <em>equation of worth</em> with a number of variables. Under different systems, the variables and weights will of course differ.</li>
<li>I extend the above point further to say that every system has a unique equation of worth. We&rsquo;ll regard each system&rsquo;s equation of worth as both the defining criteria of comparison and our method of justification.</li>
<li>I assert that the goal of the <em>&ldquo;optimal community&rdquo;</em> should be to <strong>elevate and preserve the human experience</strong>. Society at large should attempt to fulfill an amount of people based on some statistic - I&rsquo;ll refer to this statistic as the majority colloquially as that seems both intuitive and just.</li>
<li>Finally, I assert that <strong>the optimal system is defined by the equation of worth that best fulfills the goal of the optimal community</strong>. It is through this argument that I hope to justify the shortcomings of capitalism and socialism and point at the deeper intuitions of the correct answer.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="does-capitalism-work">does capitalism work?<a href="#does-capitalism-work" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h1>
<p>So, under the above definitions, let&rsquo;s consider capitalism. Capitalism&rsquo;s goal is to maximize the community&rsquo;s value through the flow of value itself. The equation of worth in a capitalist system is founded by the goal to artificially stimulated an imbalance of worth. Like most other systems, capitalist systems have variables and appropriate weights in the equation of worth for human survival and protection. However, the unique part of a capitalist system&rsquo;s equation of worth comes from the fact that it contains variables with strong weight for human happiness, satisfaction, and materialistic fulfillment. We see that this is true through the idea that innovations and products which make human life more pleasant sell well, as more people want to integrate them into their lives.</p>
<p>And yes, capitalism does accelerate the human experience, but it does so as a side effect. People are motivated to get better at things to accelerate the relative value of objects, and this constant friction spurs growth. There is no denying the dominance of dozens of real-world capitalist economies and their specific advantage in speed. Furthermore, capitalism is rudimentarily easy to put into place because the equation of worth does not need to be &ldquo;figured out&rdquo;. Placing some generally disproportionate weight on the value of human happiness and momentary satisfaction allows for the equation to converge to some equation which naturally integrates friction and mimics the trends that describe human entertainment, enjoyment, and necessity.</p>
<p>But fundamentally, the quality of an optimal thing is such that it is primarily prioritized, rather than appearance as a byproduct. By not prioritizing elevating the long-term human experience and falling prey to fluctuations of human interest, we waste resources and sideline innovation, both of which are integral to human experience. I will use the current AI movement as an example of this, which I&rsquo;m well-familiar with and can speak more credibly to than other innovative movements. Most classical sequence modeling was performed with the recurrent neural network (RNN), and although it was able to generate sequence modeling that was coherent and captured syntax based on order well, it struggled to accomodate actual meaning. After the world saw that RNNs and their extensions weren&rsquo;t enough for any meaningful processing or technology, a group of scientists at Google begun to experiment on the fundamental intuitions that outlined them, giving way to the Transformer. The Transformer Architecture proved more robust against sequence modeling, and gave way to LLMs and other extensions. The rise of the Transformer would not have happened without the clear limitations of the RNN, and the rise of the next great architecture will not occur without a clear exploitation of LLMs (which, so far, seems to be vague and woolly in practice).</p>
<p>The modern AI revolution is just one example of how innovation is only as strong as the human desire backing it in a capitalist economy. The strict goal to make money necessitates a cycle of pushing profits until they can no longer be pushed, then innovating until profits can be re-realized, and repeating.</p>
<h1 id="does-socialism-work">does socialism work?<a href="#does-socialism-work" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h1>
<p>So, if capitalism beats around the bush, what if we simplify the process? Socialism attempts to reconstruct the equation of worth with the goal of normalizing weights such that every PERSON has the same amount of value. Like Churchill&rsquo;s quote put so succinctly, even distribution of misery (or lack thereof). The weights for specific resources and responsibilities may be different, but the goal is selecting them such that everyone&rsquo;s value is uniform under the equation of worth, assuming peak efficiency. Obviously children will contribute less than adults, and those who do not contribute to their defined role in society will be &ldquo;worth less.&rdquo; However, this structure produces a relatively consistent way to achieve the same value as everyone else as long as there is equal value in contribution.</p>
<p>I say lack thereof to reference Churchill&rsquo;s quote because on paper, socialism is successful. If everything is the same, then all human experiences will have the same benefits, and the majority of the community will be happy. And indeed, optimal socialist communities would reflect this: their most prominent shortcomings can only be perceived from an outside perspective. If everyone has the same amount of everything, in a closed system, there is no need for unhappiness. The very nature of the phrase &ldquo;ignorance is bliss&rdquo; works its way into daily life. If a socialist life is all you have ever known, you have no immediate way of comparison to your neighbors, and as such, no way to be unhappy. The equation of worth motivates a life that is almost frictionless with all the lives around it.</p>
<p>However, socialism removes the fundamental ability to grow. Even a child can intuitively grasp the idea that change is what motivates growth: change not only motivates the environment for growth, but the rationale for it as well. Without an imbalance, people will never have any reason to chase anything apart from what they currently have.</p>
<p>But why does growth even matter? Recall that the goal for our optimal community is to elevate and preserve the human experience. Suppose that the population of some socialist community gets partially wiped, and the community finds themselves without any farmers. The equation of worth of a socialist community does not account for this - everyone&rsquo;s value, which is independently defined, will still be worth the same, regardless of the fact that nobody has any food. Even in a successful community, a generally</p>
<p>To call on a practical example, I reference the Soviets&rsquo; shortcomings in the space race. Although the Soviets are still extremely strong, they started</p>

<p>So, I&rsquo;m clearly against capitalism and socialism, and there are similar arguments to be made about communism and libertarianism and their shortcomings</p>
