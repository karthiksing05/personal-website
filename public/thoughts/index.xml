      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’m sure you may have heard of the economic “vicious cycle” at play. Billions of dollars are spent investing in architecture, data cleaning and storage, training, all as a select subset of companies continue to pass money back and forth, growing richer. Most real-world examples work something like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;OpenAI needs GPUs, the chip needed to run large language models, so they invest $100 into NVIDIA, a chip-making company.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;NVIDIA then invests $100 into OpenAI in the name of supporting NVIDIA’s products’ research. So, OpenAI gets GPUs for a net price of $0, NVIDIA gets the funding it needsthey need to keep manufacturing GPUs, and as a result, nothing has any worth internally to these companies, resulting in extremely inflated prices for consumers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, with 2026 around the corner, everyone is holding their breath to see if the big beast can keep feeding itself. And as always, the truth is a little more complicated than a yes or a no, as are the implications.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trigger Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; This report discusses trauma, mental illness, addiction, and eating disorders. There are mentions of suicide and self-harm and descriptions of graphic content, violence, explicit sexual situations, child sexual abuse, ethnic cleansing, and animal cruelty.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am fully outraged at what I&amp;rsquo;ve just read. This is a short commentary more than it is a blog post (I promise the capitalism one is on the way) but I write this to emphasize how much it disgusts me that this is the current state of our intellectual movement. I hope that this spurs action from all of us in some way regardless of whether we&amp;rsquo;re involved with the industry or not.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, I&amp;rsquo;m breaking my rules from post #1, and yes, this will be a highly personal, highly introspective story with some hopeful generalizations about my broader motivations in life, in the hopes that I can both find people to connect to and a broader meaning to the rest of my life.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was writing another blog post on capitalism (which is nearing its completion - it&amp;rsquo;s my longest post yet but has a lot of formalizations to go) and I wanted to convey something that means a lot to me in recent times and what I have been reflecting on as far as what it means with regards to the rest of my life. It&amp;rsquo;s about success, the most rewarding part of my high school journey, and why I am currently frightened.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It may come as a surprise to those who know me as the poster child of loving learning also despises the education system, but in the months since I&amp;rsquo;ve left high school, I can&amp;rsquo;t help but reflect on my journey in a nonpositive way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This summer, I was lucky to be connected to the Teachable AI Lab at Georgia Tech, and conducted an independent study over the course of two months analyzing a cognitive modeling algorithm. I worked with high intensity deliverables, was constantly humbled for my questions but thoroughly encouraged by my PhD advisor and Masters&amp;rsquo; coauthor, and conclusively, I learned more in those two months than I did through the majority of my senior year. It was that final realization that sparked a reflection on my interaction with the modern education system.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The title may hint that I argue in favor of predestination, but I&amp;rsquo;m prefacing this whole topic with the fact that I don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of predestination quite fundamentally and believe that debating its existence and value are two separate conversation topics. I will consider both here, but I intend for this blog to largely revolve around the second. Simply for the belief of devil&amp;rsquo;s advocacy, my goal is to reason with the concept as atheistically as possible and justify both existence and value under a framework of pure rationale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every time I meet someone in our generation who’s absolutely locked in, they seem to have a generally strong and minimalist personal website, so I wanted to take a stab at it. I write a lot to get my thoughts out into general space and I figured it would be optimal for them to have some general place to live! This initial post should hopefully offer notes on the vibes of future posts and cover some more general information on the parts of this website.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
