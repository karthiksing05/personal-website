        <p>The big question that everyone has been asking me is, &ldquo;when will the AI bubble pop?&rdquo; And indeed, our current economic climate seems to mimic signs of</p>
<p>I started out this post with the goal to take a very argumentative stance on the fact that contrary to popular belief, the AI bubble would NOT pop, and that humanity would live on. As I laid out the evidence, however, I realized that the situation was more niche than</p>
<p>I’m sure you may have heard of the economic “vicious cycle” at play. Billions of dollars spent investing in architecture, data cleaning and storage, training, all as a select subset of companies continue to pass money back and forth, growing richer. I’ll illustrate an example scenario below:</p>
<ul>
<li>OpenAI needs GPUs—the chip needed to run large language models—so they invest $100 into NVIDIA, a chip-making company.</li>
<li>NVIDIA then invests $100 into OpenAI in the name of supporting their products’ research. So, OpenAI gets free GPUs, NVIDIA gets the funding they need to keep manufacturing GPUs, and the value of all things AI becomes radically inflated.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, with 2026 around the corner, everyone is holding their breath to see if the big beast can keep feeding itself. And as always, the truth is a little more complicated than a yes or a no, as are the implications.</p>
<h1 id="definitions">definitions<a href="#definitions" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ll start by defining what an economic bubble</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Displacement:</strong> The initial phase where a new innovation, in this case, captures investor attention.</li>
<li><strong>Boom:</strong> Stock prices begin a steady ascent, initially supported by real statistics - efficiency gains, productivity increases, and things like that. Media attention and new investors are attracted. Startups pop up around the world, raising money at million- and billion-dollar valuations.</li>
<li><strong>Euphoria:</strong> A period of intense speculation where valuations accelerate rapidly, often detached from underlying cash flows. Buying into the dreams shipped by these companies is now primarily driven by the &ldquo;Fear Of Missing Out&rdquo; (FOMO).</li>
<li><strong>Profit-Taking:</strong> Some savvy investors start selling to lock in gains, leading to increased volatility, though overall optimism may remain high.</li>
<li><strong>Stagnation and Panic:</strong> All of a sudden, the new innovation just isn&rsquo;t as cool as it once was. Widespread loss of confidence in the market triggers rapid, forced selling and a sharp decline in prices (the bubble &ldquo;bursts&rdquo;). Startups around the world begin to be either acquired or go bankrupt as large players vertically assume their niches.</li>
<li><strong>Depression and Stablization:</strong> The market finds its bottom, and valuations return to more reasonable levels, leaving behind necessary infrastructure that new, more sustainable approaches can utilize.</li>
</ol>
<p>So far, we are beginning to see signs of  Michael Burry, a famous shorter of stocks, and Gary Marcus, one of the fathers of the AI movement before Gen-AI hype-train, have both spoken outwardly about liquidating their investments in AI software and infrastructure companies.</p>
<h1 id="what-even-is-the-bubble">what even is the bubble<a href="#what-even-is-the-bubble" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h1>
<p>However, I think we should be viewing the bubble is completely different. Consider it not from an economical standpoint, but from an intellectual standpoint.</p>
<p>Largely, economic bubbles are due to a new invention shaking up the scene</p>
<p>The following are problems that I believe will</p>
<ul>
<li>We are running out of data. Elon Musk has publicly commented on how xAI has ran out of tweets to train their LLMs on, and we are slowly reaching a peak of quality of data too. It’s no longer enough to train on purely text, and increasing the size and breadth of our models won’t improve hallucination rates or provide better information. Additionally, scale doesn’t solve everything. We are slowly beginning to hit a ceiling of what can be achieved through knowledge of language alone, and traditional sequential modeling is not enough to create intrinsic understanding of concepts with human-like data.</li>
<li>Speaking of human-like data, a notoriously essential part of human learning that current genAI fails to replicate is continual learning—learning over time. Unfortunately, scale only worsens this problem, making it hard to remove or adjust model biases from the training stage. Humans learn incrementally and with much less data than AI, and models of intelligence should mimic this stage, relying on prototypical generalization to “fill in the gaps” until they can be filled by data.</li>
<li>Additionally, humans can recall specific examples that produced their generation of ideas—models only retain a fuzzy image of things they were trained on, and so they cannot explain why they’ve arrived at an understanding. What you see when you prompt ChatGPT to explain its solution is a recollection of times it’s seen solutions be explained, not the actual flow of reasoning that spurs the idea. This is notably why hallucinations are not solved by scaling up. Grounding in fuzzy summaries rather than real evidence results in the tendency to make up things that are probably correct.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusions">conclusions<a href="#conclusions" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">#</a> </h1>
<p>So, wth all that being said, will the &ldquo;AI bubble&rdquo; pop? Economically, I think not. NVIDIA, Google, OpenAI, Anthropic, and every other large-scale AI company will continue to be self-supporting for years to come. Their valuations will take a hit once people realize that these companies are, for the time being, doing nothing new to show skill, but ultimately all these large players have multiple widely used products that will continue to be used until a better solution will found, and for the time being, these companies are best poised to build those better solutions.</p>
<p>However, I hope that the small economic hit will direct people to realize that the AI hype train we all chase is not all we make it out to be. The <em>bubble of innovation stagnation</em> we currently reside in</p>
<p>Where will all these startups go? My assumption is that they will move to the field of symbolic AI—building systems with interpretability, determinism, and true understanding of primitive concepts in mind. The data representations we wield will be more structured than a cloudy point in n-dimensional space, and when we ask AI why it makes decisions, we will be able to point at the training data that has resulted in the decision-making.</p>
<p>To me, the genAI bubble bursting is a good thing. We will always be chasing intelligence—either an oattempt to replicate it or accumulate it. However, our goal should be to never stagnate in our approach towards achieving intelligence. Though scale is certainly a promising response (it does explain some of why humans can operate so much more efficiently than other animals), it’s not the only thing. Humans learn continuously, from millions of years of evolution from themselves and others, and their learning is structured by very physical bounds. In order to truly achieve things like AGI and global generalization, we need to understand the fundamental thinking processes of humans and give the same structure to artificial intelligence. Agentic AI is a good next step, as it provides some very sequential structure, but by no means is it a new baseline we should cruise a year and a half on.</p>
<p>I’m particularly excited about the promise of neurosymbolic methods—”neuro” like neural networks we currently use, and “symbolic” like the original methods produced by the AI movement in the 1980s. Neural methods make use of high-dimensional vectorization as their representation, while symbolic methods leverage structured representations with discrete relations. For anyone interested, I highly recommend this article (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12205%29">https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.12205)</a>, which gives a breakdown of the many ways neural and symbolic methods can be combined. Rather than being caught up in generalizability, the original AI movement was mostly behavioral psychology and computer science meshing to create rule-based frameworks that worked like humans did. Although they were rigid in what they did and oftentimes not parallelizable, they could provide answers with reasoning grounded in data they had been trained on, and were extremely interpretable. By leveraging the strict guidelines and structure of symbolic systems with the fuzzy matching and information gains of neural representations, we achieve something truly novel. A recent paper of mine, Hierarchical Semantic Retrieval with Cobweb, leverages neural representations within a symbolic model to showcase prototype-driven organization for information retrieval.</p>
<p>I’m interested to see where all of this goes and what 2026 holds—I can only hope that we don’t settle for the idiot savants we’ve currently birthed, and return to the basics to achieve a more intelligent means of procuring and using knowledge.</p>
