My projects span both research and product design, with the goal to pioneer new AI solutions or cultivate existing AI solutions for human development rather than human replacement: in other words, a hybrid approach to human learning and growth.
ongoing efforts - [2025-08-27 - present] Encoding Model development @ LIT Lab Recently, I joined Professor Anya Ivanova and began contributing to the development of encoding models, models that can convert latent content that represents stimuli into direct voxel representations of brain states, measured by fMRI data. This project places large emphasis on model interpretability, with the goal of running large studies with brain simulations inspired by encoding models if they become successful. Currently, I am investigating alternative architectures to the traditional encoding model architecture, and attempting to apply different definitions towards interpretability behind pure sparsity in an effort to produce better fits. - [2025-06-11 - present] Cobweb for psychological &ldquo;Chunking&rdquo; @ ISLE Cobweb is a symbolic algorithm that aggregates instances into &ldquo;concepts&rdquo; and forms a hierarchy over these instances - it is unsupervised, piecemeal, and incremental, making it a comprehensive model for human learning. I am currently working with Dr. Pat Langley to implement the Cobweb algorithm in a proposed theoretical framework to model psychological &ldquo;chunking&rdquo; for efficient parsing, storage and retrieval of concepts based on a set of defined relations. If successful, this project holds large implications for the world of embeddings, able to generate a stable and continuously evolving latent space over a stream of data. - [2025-06-11 - present] Neurosymbolic Approaches for Retrieval-Augmented Generation @ TAIL (see notes on Cobweb in my work with ISLE) I am currently leading an independent study under Dr. Chris Maclellan in creating a robust, industry-sustainable neurosymbolic solution to retrieval-augmented generation for LLM pipelines, using Cobweb as the primary algorithm. After conducting studies, we submitted a paper (link coming soon!) on a preliminary study which not only qualified the efficacy of Cobweb as a search algorithm, but led to the innovation of a new metric that outperforms inner-product similarities for embeddings&rsquo; semantic comparison. I hope to use this project as a vehicle for justifying the tangible applicability of neurosymbolic systems. I also strive to analyze differentiable forms of symbolic systems like Cobweb with the goal to remove some of symbolic systems&rsquo; most fundamental timesinks. past projects - [2025-01-17 - 2025-04-17] SimplyPhi @ WISC I did volunteer work for Dr. Larissa Albantakis on a theory called Integrated Information Theory, an information-theoretic framework that attempted to calculate the distributed &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo; of the theory. I used IIT to evaluate the performance of neural networks as a saliency test, identifying the most relevant parts of the network under the &ldquo;substrate of consciousness&rdquo; defined by the framework. While IIT is an extremely assuming framework to attribute to consciousness, as a metric of &ldquo;usefulness&rdquo; by analyzing the distributed information across a system, it has a lot of play, and I look forward to seeing information theory take greater precedence in the future. - [2023-08-27 - 2025-05-25] DuluthGPT - [2024-06-18 - 2024-07-16] AI-for-Advertising @ GA GHP &lsquo;61 F - [2025-08-27 - present] BiasWrappers F - [2025-08-27 - present] 8ball F " />
