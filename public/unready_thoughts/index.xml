      <description>&lt;p&gt;The title is quite deceiving - prefacing this whole topic with the fact that I don&amp;rsquo;t like the idea of predestination quite fundamentally and believe that debating its existence and value are two separate conversation topics, both of which will be expressed here. Simply for the belief of devil&amp;rsquo;s advocacy, my goal is to reason with the concept (as someone who is agnostic-leaning-atheist) and justify both existence and value under a framework of pure rationale.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
