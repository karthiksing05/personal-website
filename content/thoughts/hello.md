Every time I meet someone in our generation who’s absolutely locked in, they seem to have a generally strong and minimalist personal website, so I wanted to take a stab at it. I write a lot to get my thoughts out into general space and I figured it would be optimal for them to have some general place to live! This initial post should hopefully offer notes on the vibes of future posts and cover some more general information on the parts of this website.

My blogs are (mostly) for me and me only. I completely acknowledge that, as of this post, I have slightly less than 18 years of life experience. Most of these pieces will be opinion pieces, based on my recollections of general life experiences and conversations with the brilliant people around me, and should be taken with many grains of salt.

Additionally, I don’t plan to blog on personal experience (though it will of course be used as corollary whenever applicable). I have the recurring curiosity of debating large and unsolved issues from as pragmatic a perspective as I can, and as aforementioned, most of my writing is designed to get my thoughts into a format that allows me to be assertive as well as 

I’m excited to reflect deeply on things that keep me up with writing, and happy that there’s finally a place to share my thoughts. If any of this is interesting, don’t hesitate to reach out.
