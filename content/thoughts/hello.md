Every time I meet someone in our generation who’s absolutely locked in, they seem to have a generally strong and minimalist personal website, so I wanted to take a stab at it. I write a lot to get my thoughts out into general space and I figured it would be optimal for them to have some general place to live! This initial post should hopefully offer notes on the vibes of future posts and cover some more general information on the parts of this website.

# this website was built in 24 hours

I am terrible at programming. I like to think that the only reason I am going to be sustainable in my career is because of my love for problem-solving, my drive to consume knowledge, and a fundamental understanding that technology is one of the fastest ways to positively impact the world at high scale. 

I always knew I wanted to do backend - theory has always been my strong suit. However, I've also always wanted to learn a personal website, and so I built this with a readymade theme in less than 24 hours using a Hugo backend, a basic knowledge of HTML and CSS, a FormSpree collection, and my faithful digital photography album.

Part of the reason I built this website was to show how deceptively simple some things really are and break through my one-size - the world of front-end is a large and complicated mystery to me still, but now I know a little bit more about design principles. Tomorrow, I may not be hired for my development skills, but I'll definitely know how to put out an MVP to support my true passions. In a world of consumerism, specialization is valuable, but change and evolution is also extremely necessary.

# notes on 'thoughts'

My blogs are (mostly) for me and me only. I completely acknowledge that, as of this post, I have slightly less than 18 years of life experience. Most of these pieces will be opinion pieces, based on my recollections of general life experiences and conversations with the brilliant people around me, and should be taken with many grains of salt.

Additionally, I don’t plan to blog on personal experience (though it will of course be used as corollary whenever applicable). I have the recurring curiosity of debating large and unsolved issues from as pragmatic a perspective as I can, and as aforementioned, most of my writing is designed to get my thoughts into a format that allows me to be assertive as well as 

# thank you!

I’m excited to reflect deeply on things that keep me up with writing, and happy that there’s finally a place to share my thoughts. If you'd like to talk, disagree, collaborate, vibe, learn - my door is always open.
