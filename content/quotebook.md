- Nothing in life is to be feared; it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less. <br>*[Marie Curie, Polish-French physicist and chemist]*
- I know very little about acting. I just jump in, have fun, and see what happens. <br>*[Robert Downey Junior, American actor and philanthropist]*
