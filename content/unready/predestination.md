The title may hint that I argue in favor of predestination, but I'm prefacing this whole topic with the fact that I don't like the idea of predestination quite fundamentally and believe that debating its existence and value are two separate conversation topics. I will consider both here, but I intend for this blog to largely revolve around the second. Simply for the belief of devil's advocacy, my goal is to reason with the concept as atheistically as possible and justify both existence and value under a framework of pure rationale.

Also, a huge thank you to my friends for continually and constantly entertaining these wild thoughts - such discussions are not easy and my beliefs would not be formed without their intellectual company and support.

# definition

We'll define predestination as the idea that our life and the lives of everyone around us has been predecided, whether by the natural laws of the universe or some primal, omnipotent, allknowing entity. I like to think of it more conversationally as walking on a path that has already been set for you. Of course, you will feel as though you are exploring this path for the first time, but that does not 

# the closed environment

Now, in the broader context, the first main problem most have with predestination 

# infinite predestination

# does any of this really matter?

# q.e.d.

So, in conclusion, I remain as clueless as I was when I started these conversations with my friends. However, I seem to have gained a deeper appreciation for the novelty of physics (which will be touched on soon). The idea of closed-form solutions captivates me, and though it seems plausible that life itself can be represented by some pithy but grandiose equation, it seems even more plausible that everything about random chance I asserted was justified by an incomplete understanding of what frame of reference truly implies. Still, I find that it was extremely important for me to take this mental journey for the same reason it's important to debate predestination in general. 

It truly is about accountability in this specific sense and in a general sense: we should all have the accountability to pursue depth and reject what we believe for the sake of discussion.
