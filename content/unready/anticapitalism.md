This post is quite unorthodox for me, as I always try to keep my political beliefs out of social discussion, and I will be avoiding referencing real countries and governments so as to preserve the sanctity of the argument without bias. However, this work is extremely necessary, especially in light of some recent events regarding political activism and funding, not just in the USA, but across the world. This is a broader commentary on where power should come from, where priorities should lie, and what to take as "valuable" to iterate on humanity's best whilst learning to let go of what holds us back. I'll be discussing things in terms of resource allocation, so a more economical perspective, but know that my views can be easily transferred to a political dimension by referencing the value and distribution of responsibilities rather than resources.

Many who know me know that I deeply enjoy bashing on capitalism. Few know why I bash on capitalism (I promise it is for more than "the bit", as I will explain later on in the article). Fewer still know that not only would I bash on capitalism (and socialism), but that I've already devised the workings of a secret third system that is deceptively simple by nature but incredibly challenging to put into practice. 

Additionally, though many other systems currently exist, I will be referring to capitalism and socialism in depth as they represent the natural opposites to the gradient of systems I define.

# goals and definitions

In an effort to remain impartial while understanding this problem as analytically as possible, I'm going to formalize some of the goals and definitions I have within the broader context of this subject, so that my lines of reasoning can be understood. Everything in this section is an assumption which I believe isn't wildly out of pocket, but I welcome additions and adjustments.

First, I define a system. These "systems" that I discuss can be thought of economically, militarily, politically, etc. I generalize all of these things to the idea that a "system" described within my framework is an *allocation of resources and responsibilities* within a community. Every community is backed by one of these systems. Politically, capitalism can be represented as the natural ordering of responsibilities such that everyone has a valued role in society proportional to their value as members of the community, and socialism can be represented as the natural ordering of responsibilities such that everyone has an equal role in society, independent of value.

Now that we've defined a system, I'm going to assert that it has the following properties:
*   I touched on this briefly in the last paragraph, but I justify that everything has value, and the value of everything can be categorized by some mystical equation, which I will reference as the *equation of worth* with a number of variables. Under different systems, the variables and weights will of course differ.
*   I extend the above point further to say that every system has a unique equation of worth. We'll regard each system's equation of worth as both the defining criteria of comparison and our method of justification.
*   I assert that the goal of the "optimal community" should be to elevate the human experience. Society at large should attempt to fulfill an amount of people based on some statistic - I'll refer to this statistic as the majority colloquially as that seems both intuitive and just.
*   Finally, I assert that the optimal system is defined by the equation of worth that best fulfills the goal of the optimal community. It is through this argument that I hope to justify the shortcomings of capitalism and socialism and point at the deeper intuitions of the correct answer.

# does capitalism work?

So, under the above definitions, let's consider capitalism. As a system that allocates resources and responsibilities, capitalism's goal is to maximize the community's value through the flow of value itself. The equation of worth in a capitalist system is founded by the goal to artificially stimulated an imbalance of worth. Like most other systems, capitalist systems have variables and appropriate weights in the equation of worth for human survival and protection. However, the unique part of a capitalist system's equation of worth comes from the fact that it contains variables with strong weight for human happiness, satisfaction, and materialistic fulfillment. We see that this is true through the idea that innovations and products which make human life more pleasant sell well, as more people want to integrate them into their lives.

And yes, capitalism does accelerate the human experience, it does so as a side effect. People are motivated to get better at things to accelerate the relative value of objects, and this constant friction spurs growth. There is no denying the dominance of dozens of real-world capitalist economies and their specific advantage in speed. Furthermore, capitalism is rudimentarily easy to put into place because the equation of worth does not need to be "figured out". Placing some generically disproportionate weight on the value of human happiness allows for the equation to converge to some equation which naturally integrates friction and mimics the trends that describe human entertainment, enjoyment, and necessity.

But fundamentally, the quality of an optimal thing is such that it is primarily prioritized, rather than appearance as a byproduct. By not prioritizing elevating the long-term human experience and falling prey to fluctuations of human interest, we waste resources and sideline innovation, both of which are integral to human experience. I will use the current AI movement as an example of this, which I'm well-familiar with. The stagnation of the RNN (which was the precursor to modern architectures)

# does socialism work?

So, if capitalism is too convoluted, what if we simplify the process? Socialism attempts to reconstruct the equation of worth with the goal of normalizing weights such that everything is worth the same, to justify distributing everything equally. Like Churchill's quote put so succinctly, even distribution of misery (or lack thereof).

On paper, socialism is successful because if everything is the same, then all human experiences will have the same benefits, and the majority of the community will be happy. And indeed, optimal socialist communities would reflect this: their most prominent shortcomings are only viewable
